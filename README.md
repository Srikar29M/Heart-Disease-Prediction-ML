# Heart Disease Prediction Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the dataset, identifying patterns, and presenting insights clearly. Below are explanations of the various visualizations used in the analysis of heart disease prediction data.

## 1. Correlation Matrix
**Heatmap**: A correlation matrix visualizes the relationship between features. The heatmap displays correlation coefficients, helping identify which features are strongly correlated with each other and with the target variable (heart disease presence). The color intensity indicates the strength of the correlation.

## 2. Target Variable Distribution
**Countplot**: This plot shows the distribution of the target variable, indicating the balance between patients with heart disease and those without. Understanding this distribution helps assess class imbalance, which can influence model training.

## 3. Gender Distribution
**Countplot**: Visualizing gender distribution provides insights into the demographic makeup of the dataset, allowing exploration of potential gender disparities in heart disease.

## 4. Chest Pain Type vs. Target
**Countplot**: This visualization examines the relationship between chest pain type and the presence of heart disease, helping to understand if certain types of chest pain correlate with higher risks.

## 5. Fasting Blood Sugar vs. Target
**Countplot**: This plot shows how fasting blood sugar levels relate to heart disease outcomes, helping identify potential risk factors associated with high blood sugar levels.

## 6. Resting ECG Results vs. Target
**Countplot**: Similar to previous plots, this one explores the relationship between resting ECG results and heart disease, providing valuable diagnostic insights.

## 7. Exercise-induced Angina vs. Target
**Countplot**: This visualization assesses the impact of exercise-induced angina on heart disease outcomes, revealing possible associations.

## 8. Age Distribution by Target
**Boxplot**: This plot shows the distribution of patient ages based on their heart disease status, highlighting age-related patterns and the central tendency within each group.

## 9. Resting Blood Pressure by Target
**Boxplot**: This visualization presents resting blood pressure distributions, helping to identify any significant differences between patients with and without heart disease.

## 10. ST Depression by Target
**Boxplot**: This plot highlights differences in ST depression levels, which can be a key indicator in diagnosing heart disease.

## 11. Feature Correlations with Target
**Heatmap**: Another heatmap focused solely on the correlation of features with the target variable. It aids in identifying the most significant predictors of heart disease.

## 12. Age Distribution by Target (Histogram)
**Histogram**: This plot provides a detailed view of age distribution, with density estimates (KDE) for both classes (with and without heart disease).

## 13. Max Heart Rate Achieved Distribution by Target (Histogram)
**Histogram**: Similar to the age histogram, this visualization focuses on max heart rate achievements, offering insights into how it correlates with heart disease.

## 14. Average Age of Patients with and without Heart Disease (Line Plot)
**Line Plot**: This plot tracks the average age for each heart disease category, indicating trends in age among affected and unaffected individuals.

## 15. Gender Distribution by Heart Disease (Stacked Bar Plot)
**Stacked Bar Plot**: This visualization illustrates how gender and heart disease status are related, helping to uncover potential demographic trends.

## 16. Distribution of Heart Disease (Pie Chart)
**Pie Chart**: This chart provides a quick view of the proportion of patients with and without heart disease, offering a clear representation of the dataset's balance.

## 17. Chest Pain Type Distribution (Donut Chart)
**Donut Chart**: Similar to the pie chart, this visualization highlights the prevalence of different chest pain types among patients.

## 18. Average Cholesterol Levels by Age Group
**Line Plot**: This plot reveals how average cholesterol levels vary across different age groups, which can be essential for identifying risk factors related to age.

## 19. Count of Patients by Chest Pain Type
**Countplot**: This plot shows the distribution of patients across different chest pain types, aiding in understanding the commonness of each type.

## 20. Count of Patients by Fasting Blood Sugar Status
**Countplot**: This visualization details how many patients have fasting blood sugar levels above or below the threshold, giving insights into potential health risks.
